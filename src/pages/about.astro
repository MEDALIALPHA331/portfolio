        I graduated from the Higher Institute of Computer Science and Multimedia of Sfax in June 2023 with a degree in computer science specialized in big data and data analysis. Since then, I have spent much of my time honing my skills as a full-stack JavaScript developer, learning languages like React, Next.js, and TypeScript, and more recently Sveltekit & Astro.

        More recently, I've begun exploring Rust for its safety and efficiency. I also have experience with other languages such as Go. Beyond coding, I take great interest in cloud and DevOps technologies from AWS (I hold an AWS Cloud practitioner certification, and studying for the next one) to servereless and edge solutions like Vercel, as well as tools like Docker, Terraform and Ansible. When not working on projects, you'll find me reading technical books and blogs and exploring new technologies and concepts through tutorials.

        Outside of software, I love camping and going to the Cinema, I also volunteer my skills wherever I can and take pride in helping improve opportunities in my hometown through civic participation and environmental causes. Travel also remains a strong passion of mine, and I hope to continue expanding my horizons in the future. My goal is to build upon my education and use technology to help develop solutions for my country and community.
